This script addresses the iOS bug whereby rotating the device results in the web page becoming zoomed in, making for a very awkward user experience. 

This script, which goes in the footer of your site, disables any sort of scaling:
- page load 
- upon rotating into landscape mode. 

However, as soon as the user touches the screen, or rotates into portrait mode, scaling becomes reenabled.

So you get the best of both worlds:
- No ugly auto-zooming upon page rotation
- Users keep the ability to pinch in and out for zooming
